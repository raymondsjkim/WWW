  				 <p>It is recommended to use FTP to download Hi-res product images due to the large file sizes (File size averages 150Mb) as FTP provides stable file transfer. <br />
<br />
For <strong>first time FTP users</strong>, Please follow the instructions below to download and install a FTP client software to access our FTP server. <br />
For advance users who already have FTP client installed, please skip to Step3 for the FTP login info.</p>  <br />

                        <li>If you don't have any FTP client, we recommend CoreFTP for its stability, you can donwload it using the following link. <a href="http://www.download.com/Core-FTP-LE/3000-2160_4-10195752.html" target="_blank">http://www.download.com/Core-FTP-LE/3000-2160_4-10195752.html</a>.
